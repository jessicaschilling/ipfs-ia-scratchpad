## About IPFS

Feel free to reprint the information in this section in its entirety without explicit approval.

### Long description
IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol for content addressing. An alternative to the HTTP protocol, IPFS builds on the principles of peer-to-peer networking and content-based addressing to create a decentralized, distributed, and trustless data storage and delivery network. With IPFS, users ask for a file and the system finds and delivers the closest copy without the need to trust a centralized delivery source. In addition to more efficient content distribution, IPFS offers improved security, content integrity, and resistance to third-party tampering. **(621 characters/95 words)**

### Short description
IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more user-centered. IPFS upgrades the web to work peer to peer, addressing data by _what_ it is instead of _where_ itâ€™s located on the network, or _who_ is hosting it. **(282 characters/52 words)**
